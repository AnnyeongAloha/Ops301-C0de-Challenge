# Purpose: Create a python script that uses if statements using logical conditions

#!/usr/bin/env python3

# Define variables 

ouid = 66 
booze = 666 

# ouid == booze 
# ouid != booze
# ouid < booze
# ouid <= booze
# ouid > booze 
# ouid >= booze 

# Create if statements and print information to the screen depending on conditions met

if ouid == booze:
    print(ouid and booze are equal)
    elif ouid > god 
        print("ouid is greater than booze")
    elif ouid != booze
        print("ouid is not booze, Son!")
    elif ouid < booze
        print("ouid is less than booze")
    elif ouid <= booze
        print("ouid is less than booze but not greater than booze"
    elif ouid > booze 
        print("ouid is greater than booze")
    elif ouid >= booze
        print("ouid is greater but not less than booze") 
else:
    print("GTFO!")
if a == b and c != d: 
    print("you clown")


Groceries = ["ouid", "booze", "pong table", "pizza"]
print(Groceries[0])
