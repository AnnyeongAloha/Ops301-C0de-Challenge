# Purpose: Create a python script that uses if statements using logical conditions

#!/usr/bin/env python3

# Define variables 

a = 66 
b = 666 

a == b 
a != b
a < b
a <= b
a > b 
a >= b 

# Create if statements and print information to the screen depending on conditions met

if a == b:
    print(a and b are equal)
    elif a > b 
    print(a is greater than b)
    elif a != b
    print(a is not b, Son!)
